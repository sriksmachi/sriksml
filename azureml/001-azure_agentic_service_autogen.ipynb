    "# Multi Agent orchestrator using Azure AI Agentic Service\n",
    "\n",
    "**Problem Statement**: AI agents are autonomous software entities designed to perform tasks, make decisions, and interact with environments using artificial intelligence, machine learning, natural language processing, and reinforcement learning. However, every custom AI agent written today needs lifecycle management, that includes packaging as containers, deployment, scaling, allocation of right resources etc. As the number of agents grow in your ecosystem it becomes tedious to manage the environment.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Azure AI Agent Service** is a fully managed service designed to empower developers to securely build, deploy, and scale high-quality, and extensible AI agents without needing to manage the underlying compute and storage resources. We can use Azure AI Agent Service to create and run an agent in just a few lines of code. You can also manage complex workflows with **AutoGen** and **Semantic Kernel**.\n",

    "\n",
    "In an era where large language models (LLMs) are rapidly evolving, the efficacy of their evaluation has become an urgent necessity. Traditional methods often involve costly human evaluations that can compromise privacy and reproducibility. **Enter \"RocketEval.\"**\n",
    "\n",
    "**Context:** This groundbreaking research presented at ICLR 2025 explores how lightweight LLMs can serve as highly-efficient evaluators through a structured checklist approach. By transitioning the evaluation process from subjective human judgments to a systematic, automated framework, researchers have opened new avenues for cost-effective, scalable assessments that align closely with human preferences.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Insights:** \n",
    "- **Key Findings**: The RocketEval framework demonstrates a remarkable correlation of **0.965** with human evaluations using a lightweight model (Gemma-2-2B), achieving results comparable to powerful models like GPT-4, but at **over a 50-fold** cost reduction! \n",
    "- **Innovative Approach**: By reframing evaluations into multi-faceted checklists, the study addresses common pitfalls in LLM assessments: high uncertainty and positional bias. This systematic approach ensures that critical aspects of a model's response are thoroughly evaluated, leading to more reliable outputs.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Engagement Trigger:** As the landscape of AI continues to shift, how can we ensure that our evaluation methods keep pace with the technology? Do you believe automated systems can fully replace human evaluators, or is there still value in the human touch in this process?\n",

## Details

### `rnn-glove-embeddings.ipynb`
This notebook focuses on building a simple RNN model for text generation using GloVe embeddings. It compares character-based and word-based language RNNs, highlighting their pros and cons. The model demonstrates how to use pre-trained GloVe embeddings to enhance text generation.

### `rnn-trained-embeddings.ipynb`
This notebook demonstrates how to train your own word embeddings and use them in an RNN model for text generation. It provides insights into the advantages of self-trained embeddings and compares them with pre-trained embeddings like GloVe.

### `azure_agentic_service_autogen.ipynb`
This notebook showcases the capabilities of Azure AI Agentic Service, a fully managed service for creating, deploying, and scaling AI agents. It includes examples of using AutoGen and Semantic Kernel to manage complex workflows and demonstrates summarizing a research paper into a LinkedIn post using Azure services.

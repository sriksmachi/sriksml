    "# 🤖 Multimodal RAG with Embeddings of Text, Image, and Table Summaries\n",
    "#### A cookbook for deriving more value from multi-modal data in Enterprise RAG Applications\n",
    "\n",
    "### 🗂️ Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "Why Most Enterprise RAG Applications Fall Short: The Overlooked Importance of Context Engineering ?\n",
    "\n",
    "Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) applications are rapidly gaining traction across enterprises, offering powerful capabilities for knowledge retrieval and generative insights. However, the true effectiveness of these solutions hinges on a critical but often underestimated component—**data extraction and context engineering**. This notebook deals with 3 most-common problems seen in Enterprise RAG Applications.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Multi-Modal data extraction**: Many RAG implementations fail to deliver tangible value because they rely solely on extracting plain text from source documents. This narrow approach overlooks the rich, structured, and visual data often embedded in enterprise content—such as **images, charts, and tables**. For instance, financial reports and research papers frequently convey essential information through non-textual formats that are crucial for accurate understanding and meaningful generation. Neglecting this rich content leads to incomplete context, ultimately resulting in **subpar performance and poor-quality outputs**. To build truly effective RAG solutions, enterprises must adopt a more comprehensive content extraction strategy—one that intelligently incorporates all relevant modalities, not just text.\n",
    "2. **Text only inputs to LLM in Generation Phase** : Another common pitfall in enterprise RAG applications is the exclusive reliance on text when interacting with large language models (LLMs). When only textual data is passed to the model, valuable information embedded in images, tables, and other visual elements—which are often used to clarify, quantify, or summarize insights—is lost. This significantly weakens the model’s ability to generate accurate, complete responses.\n",
    "3. **Cohesive Search Documents**: Equally important is the cohesion of extracted content. In most documents, information is presented in a tightly interlinked manner—text, visuals, and structured data are intentionally designed to work together to convey meaning. Extracting and using only fragments of that information disrupts this contextual integrity. For example, referencing a table without its corresponding explanatory text—or vice versa—can lead to misleading or incomplete answers. To achieve high-quality, reliable outputs, RAG applications must preserve this semantic cohesion during retrieval and context construction. This involves not only multimodal extraction but also thoughtful chunking, ranking, and packaging of information before it’s passed to the LLM.In essence, effective RAG isn’t just about finding relevant documents—it’s about preserving the full fidelity and structure of information within them. Overlooking this principle is a key reason why many enterprise RAG deployments underperform.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook demonstrates how to leverage Azure AI services to build a robust multimodal RAG pipeline, enabling efficient data extraction, summarization, and **multi-vector** fields for downstream tasks.\n",
    "The following section defines key learning objectives in each section. \n",
    "\n",
    "### 🎯 Key learning Objectives\n",
    "\n",
    "1. 📄 **Data Extraction**: In this notebook we will learn to extract all types of data from rich PDFs using Azure Document Intelligence. \n",
    "2. 📝 **Summarization**: Implement text, table, and image summarization using Azure OpenAI models. At this stage we will also organize the data into a data-structure that supports **multi-vector** indexes.\n",
    "3. 🧠 **Embedding & Search**: Create vector embeddings for multimodal data (text, images) and store them in Azure AI Search for efficient retrieval. Reshape search results to optimize context for text generation using both text and image data. Finally, demonstrate how relevant retrieved images enhance the generated response.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 🏁 Conclusion\n",
    "\n",
    "By the end of this notebook, users will have a clear understanding of how to build a multimodal RAG pipeline that integrates text, image, and table data for advanced AI applications. This approach enhances the ability to generate meaningful insights from diverse data sources, paving the way for innovative solutions in enterprise and research domains. In short, robust context engineering is not optional—it’s foundational. Without it, even the most advanced RAG systems are at risk of missing the mark.🚀"

    "\n",
    "This notebook uses a public preview feature in Azure AI Search called [Multi-vector field](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/search/vector-search-multi-vector-fields). It allows indexing multiple child vectors within a single document field, making it particularly effective for multimodal data or long-form documents, where a single vector representation may lose important context or detail. We can embed multiple chunks of a document and associate those embeddings with the parent document, allowing retriever hits on the chunks to return the larger document. This capability ensures finer-grained retrieval and relevance when working with diverse data types like text and images.\n",
    "\n",
    "Since this feature is in preview the only support method to create the Index is via Portal or REST API. Before you proceed make sure the index is created in Azure Search either from the portal or via REST API. \n",
